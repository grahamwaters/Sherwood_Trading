Your markdown is mostly accurate, but there are a few points that need to be clarified:

1. In the "Order of calls to the Robinhood API" section, you mentioned that you are getting the crypto buying power for the account (step 4). However, this information is already retrieved in step 2 when you call `r.profiles.load_account_profile()`. You don't need to make an additional call for this.

2. In the "Call Costs for these steps" section, you mentioned that step 5 (Get the crypto info for every coin in the `coins` list) costs 5N calls to the Robinhood API. However, you didn't mention this step in the "Order of calls to the Robinhood API" section. If you're not actually making this call, then you should remove this from the call costs.

3. In the "Total number of calls to the Robinhood API" section, you calculated the total number of calls as `8N + 9`. However, based on your "Call Costs for these steps" section, the correct calculation should be `7N + 4` (assuming you remove the redundant crypto buying power call and the unmentioned crypto info call).

Here's the corrected version of your markdown:

```md
## Order of calls to the Robinhood API
1. Get the latest price and the historical prices for every coin in the `coins` list.
2. Get the profile data for the account.
3. Get the crypto positions for the account.
4. (no calls) Update the dataframe `crypto_data` with the latest data from the Robinhood API. Calculate the Technical Indicators for each coin in the `coins` list. Also calculate the `signal` for each coin in the `coins` list.
5. (no calls) Filter the dataframe `crypto_data` to only include coins that have a `signal` of `buy`.
6. Buy the coins in the `coins` list that have a `signal` of `buy`.
7. (no calls) filter the dataframe `crypto_data` to only include coins that have a `signal` of `sell`.
8. Sell the coins in the `coins` list that have a `signal` of `sell`.
9. Update the dataframe `crypto_data` with the latest data from the Robinhood API. Calculate the Technical Indicators for each coin in the `coins` list. Also calculate the `signal` for each coin in the `coins` list. Find out what our profit is so far, and how much equity we have.
10. (no calls) Save the dataframe `crypto_data` to a csv file.

## Call Costs for these steps
1. 2N calls to the Robinhood API
2. 1 call to the Robinhood API
3. 1 call to the Robinhood API
4. 0 calls to the Robinhood API
5. 0 calls to the Robinhood API
6. (1 to N) calls to the Robinhood API (depending on how many coins we are buying)
7. 0 calls to the Robinhood API
8. (1 to N) calls to the Robinhood API (depending on how many coins we are selling)
9. 2N calls to the Robinhood API (we need to update the data for the coins we are trading)
10. 0 calls to the Robinhood API

## Total number of calls to the Robinhood API

The total number of calls to the Robinhood API is as follows:

Total_Calls = 5N + 2

where N is the number of coins we are trading. If we are trading 10 coins, then the total number of calls to the Robinhood API

is 52.
