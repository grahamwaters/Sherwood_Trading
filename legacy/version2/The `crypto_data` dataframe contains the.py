The `crypto_data` dataframe contains the following columns:

- `ticker` (str): The ticker symbol of the cryptocurrency.
- `current_price` (float): The current price of the cryptocurrency.
- `historical_prices` (list of floats): The historical prices of the cryptocurrency.
- `rsi` (float): The Relative Strength Index of the cryptocurrency.
- `macd` (float): The Moving Average Convergence Divergence of the cryptocurrency.
- `bollinger_bands` (float): The Bollinger Bands of the cryptocurrency.
- `minimum_order_size` (float): The minimum order size for the cryptocurrency.
- `coin_holdings` (float): The amount of the cryptocurrency currently held.
- `updated_at` (datetime): The time when the data was last updated.
- `previous_equity` (float): The previous equity value.
- `current_equity` (float): The current equity value.
- `daily_profit` (float): The daily profit, calculated as `current_equity - previous_equity`.
- `buying_power` (float): The buying power available.
- `profile` (dict): The profile data of the account.

To minimize the number of calls to the Robinhood API, we can consolidate the calls as follows:

1. Call `r.get_crypto_historicals()`: This call retrieves the latest price (the 'mark_price') and the list of historical prices. The latest price is saved as `current_price` and the list of historical prices is saved as `historical_prices` in the `crypto_data` dataframe.

2. Call `r.profiles.load_account_profile()`: This call retrieves the buying power and the profile data. The buying power is saved as `buying_power` and the profile data is saved as `profile` in the `crypto_data` dataframe.

3. Call `r.crypto.get_crypto_positions()`: This call retrieves the minimum order size, the name of the coin, the number of coins currently held, and the time the data was last updated. These values are saved as `min_order_size`, `name`, `coin_holdings`, and `updated_at` respectively in the `crypto_data` dataframe.

4. Call `r.profile_data()`: This call retrieves the current equity and the previous equity. These values are saved as `current_equity` and `previous_equity` respectively in the `crypto_data` dataframe. The `daily_profit` is then calculated as `current_equity - previous_equity`.

The total number of API calls is as follows:

- 1 call to `r.get_crypto_historicals()`
- 1 call to `r.profiles.load_account_profile()`
- 1 call to `r.crypto.get_crypto_positions()`
- 1 call to `r.profile_data()`

This results in a total of 4 API calls per cryptocurrency. Therefore, if we are trading N cryptocurrencies, the total number of API calls would be 4N.

After the data is retrieved and saved in the `crypto_data` dataframe, we can perform further analysis and trading operations without making additional API calls. This includes calculating technical indicators, generating trading signals, executing trades, and updating the dataframe with the latest data.


In real-time day trading and price scalping scenarios, the frequency of data updates is crucial. However, it's also important to minimize the number of API calls to avoid hitting rate limits and to reduce the load on the server. Here are some strategies to achieve this balance:

1. **Batch Requests**: If the API supports it, try to make batch requests. Instead of making separate requests for each cryptocurrency, make a single request for all the cryptocurrencies you're interested in. This can significantly reduce the number of API calls.

2. **Selective Updates**: Update only the data that is necessary for your trading strategy. For example, if you're scalping based on the current price and volume, you may not need to update historical prices or other indicators as frequently.

3. **Smart Scheduling**: Schedule your API calls intelligently. For example, you could make more frequent updates during high volatility periods and less frequent updates during quieter periods. You could also stagger your API calls to avoid making too many requests at once.

4. **Local Caching**: Store the data locally and update it incrementally. Instead of retrieving the entire historical data every time, you could retrieve only the new data and append it to your local dataset. This can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred in each API call.

5. **Use Websockets**: If the API provides a websocket interface, consider using it for real-time updates. Websockets provide a persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing the server to push updates to the client as soon as they occur. This can be more efficient than polling the server for updates at a fixed interval.

6. **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Keep track of your API usage to avoid hitting rate limits. Most APIs have a limit on the number of requests you can make in a certain time period. Be aware of these limits and plan your API calls accordingly.

Remember, the goal is to get the data you need for your trading strategy while making the least number of API calls. This requires a careful balance between data freshness and API usage. Always respect the API's usage policies and strive to be a good citizen of the API ecosystem.

Here is a basic outline of trading using BTC as the example Currency:
```
Sure, here's a step-by-step breakdown of the API calls that would occur while day trading Bitcoin (BTC) using the Robinhood API:

1. **Retrieve Historical Data for BTC**
   - API Call: `r.get_crypto_historicals('BTC')`
   - Purpose: This call retrieves the latest price and the list of historical prices for Bitcoin. The latest price is saved as `current_price` and the list of historical prices is saved as `historical_prices` in the `crypto_data` dataframe.

2. **Load Account Profile**
   - API Call: `r.profiles.load_account_profile()`
   - Purpose: This call retrieves the buying power and the profile data. The buying power is saved as `buying_power` and the profile data is saved as `profile` in the `crypto_data` dataframe.

3. **Get Crypto Positions**
   - API Call: `r.crypto.get_crypto_positions()`
   - Purpose: This call retrieves the minimum order size, the name of the coin, the number of coins currently held, and the time the data was last updated. These values are saved as `min_order_size`, `name`, `coin_holdings`, and `updated_at` respectively in the `crypto_data` dataframe.

4. **Retrieve Profile Data**
   - API Call: `r.profile_data()`
   - Purpose: This call retrieves the current equity and the previous equity. These values are saved as `current_equity` and `previous_equity` respectively in the `crypto_data` dataframe. The `daily_profit` is then calculated as `current_equity - previous_equity`.

5. **Generate Trading Signals**
   - No API Call: At this point, you would typically use the data you've gathered to generate trading signals. This could involve calculating technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), or Bollinger Bands, and then generating buy or sell signals based on these indicators.

6. **Execute Trades**
   - API Call: `r.order_buy_crypto_limit('BTC', quantity, price)` or `r.order_sell_crypto_limit('BTC', quantity, price)`
   - Purpose: These calls execute trades based on the trading signals. If the signal is to buy, you would use `r.order_buy_crypto_limit` to place a limit order to buy Bitcoin. If the signal is to sell, you would use `r.order_sell_crypto_limit` to place a limit order to sell Bitcoin.

7. **Update Data**
   - Repeat Steps 1-4: After executing trades, you would repeat steps 1-4 to update the `crypto_data` dataframe with the latest data.

This process would continue throughout the day as you day trade Bitcoin. Please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading strategies can be much more complex. Also, always remember to follow all applicable laws and regulations when trading.
